          Calculus sometimes studies objects called series, which are most often defined as a summation of an infinite sequence. Series can <i>converge</i> 
          to a limiting number, or not. When they don't converge, we say the <i>diverge</i>. There are a variety of tests we can use to determine whether they
          converge, but fundamentally, it all depends on the series' <i>sequence of partial sums</i>, which this lesson will show you how to set up in Desmos.

        <ol>
          <li>On line one, enter the real-valued function "f(x)=1/x". We actually don't need to graph this function, though, so click the dot icon to turn off its graph.</li>
          <li>On line two, type "n=1". Define its minimum and maximum values as 1 and 10000, and set the step to 1. A slider will be generated. (Note: Desmos only supports lists
            of 10000 elements, thus the reason for the maximum value of n.)
          </li>
          <li>On line three, define a list of counting numbers from 1 to n by typing "K=[1...n]". See that the list updates as you change the value of n.</li>
          <li>On line four, define the partial sums for the function you entered on line 1 by typing "S=sum". Desmos will change the word sum into sigma notation, at which
            point you should change the lower limit of the summation to "k=1" and the upper limit (above the sigma) to "K". Finally, to the right of the sigma, type "f(k)". 
            Since these may be new to you, let's discuss what you've just generated.<br><br>Summation notation means to substitute all of the values from the lower limit to the upper
            limit into the function, and then add them up. Since we defined the upper limit of the sum as a list/sequence, this has also given us a list/sequence.
            <br><br>To better understand this, make sure that the value of n is 1. S will be a list of only one element, 1/1=1. Now set n=3, and you'll see that it is now
            a list of three elements. 1/1=1, 1/1+1/2=1.5, and 1/1+1/2+1/3=1.83333333... If you now change n to n=4, the next partial sum in the sequence will be generated.<br><br>
          </li>
          <li>Everything will be easier to understand if we put it in a table, which is easy to do in Desmos. Click the "+" icon at the top left corner and choose table. 
            Change x_1 to K, and y_1 to S. Notice that Desmos now plots these coordinate pairs, and you can click the magnifying glass icon to the left of the table to have
            Desmos zoom for you.<br><br>
            Change the value of n to n=100. Notice that the table omits part of the sequence, but clicking the magnifying glass will change the view. You should see that the 
            partial sums now reach 5.1873775, so they are increasing at a slower rate, but still increasing. (I'll let you guess whether this sequence of partial sums converges or diverges.)<br><br>
          </li>
          <li>We did a lot to set this up, but let's see how easy it is to change to a different function. Back on line 1, change the function to "1/x^2". You will see the table change, and you 
            should also notice that the sequence appears to be approaching a horizontal asymptote. (I'll let you guess whether this sequence converges or diverges.)
          </li>
          <li>With n=100, enter the final value from this sequence of partial sums. Then check your work.</li>
        </ol>
