          Recall that a definite integral gives the net change of the function's antiderivative, and Desmos can estimate them with high accuracy.
          Definite integrals can be interpreted in many ways, most commonly as an accumulation of "area" between the curve and the x-axis. Recall, however,
          that this is true only when the function is nonnegative and integrable over the closed interval formed by the limits of integration.

        <ol>
          <li>On line 1, type "f(x)=x*ln{x}"</li>
          <li>On line 2, type "int", which will give a template for a definite integral. Enter 0 and 3 as the lower and upper limits (you'll have to tab or click
            between the inputs), type "f(x)" for the integrand, and certainly don't forget the differential "f(x)".</li>
          <li>Note that this integral has two unusual features. Consider: <i>What is true about the value of the integrand at the lower limit of integration?
            Does the value that Desmos gives equal the area of the region bounded by the function and x-axis from x=0 to x=3?</i>
          </li>
          <li>Input the value of the integral, accurate to three decimal places, and click the button to check your work.</li>
